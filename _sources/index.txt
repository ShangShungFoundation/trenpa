TRENPA
------

**TRENPA** *(Tib. Memory དྲན་པ། )* is a software platform enabling management of acquisition, cataloguing, curating, preserving, dissemination access and collaboration for both physical and digital archive, with strong support for multimedia content.

It follows the best archival practices and complies to ISO 14721:2003 [19]_

Vocabulary
----------

Archive
   An organization of people and systems that have accepted the responsibility to protect, retain, and preserve information and data and make it available for a Designated Communityâ€� Source: ISO 14721 [19]_

Repository
   Network accessible file server or cloud service

Item
   The object or "stuff" that metadata is "about" whether it is physical or digital. Each item has an identifier that is unique within the scope of the repository of which it is a constituent. Item basic properties relate to the Dublin Core scheme. 

Collection
   Assembly of items gathered by particular criteria. Collections may be hierarchical (one can belong to another) and heterogeneous (can contain different classes of items). One item may belong to various Collections. 

Bundle
   Assembly of items which, for particular reasons, have to be treated as a whole. Example: HTML page, consequent audio recordings, scanned pages of a book etc.

Essence
   Original item or the highest-quality representation of an item selected from various copies of the given item. 

Protocol
   Well defined list of steps and practices used to achieve a certain goal (ex: acquire a new archival item). 

Policy
   0fficial public statement that describes collection's [18]_:

   * purpose
   * why it collects
   * what it collects
   * what it does not collect
   * who can use the material collected


Person
   Broad definition of an individual or an institution *(like in law jargon)*

Consumer
   The role played by those persons, or client systems, who interact with TRENPA services to find preserved information of interest and to access that information in detail.

Acquisition
   Process of accepting material into the archive. In TRENPA it refers to the physical items. 

Ingestion
   Acquisition of a digital item into the archive. In TRENPA it refers to the digital item which could be transformed (transcoded). 

Digitalization
   Ingestion of a file which is the result of digitalization of analogue media. 

Dissemination
   Making available an archived item to the Consumer. Item may be transformed (transcoded) to meet broadcast necessities. [24]_


Purpose
-------

*TRENPA* is born from necessity to manage Shang Shung Institute physical and digital archives. 
Most archival software addresses or physical or digital Archive (Fedora, DSpace). 
In the multimedia library physical media get digitalized, so a bridge and mutual reference between physical and digital objects are necessary. 

Since the biggest part of SSI Archive consist of multimedia items TRENPA contains specialized data models (Events) and functionality to support them. Most of digital repositories apply atomic approach to item metadata. It means that each item has self-contained metadata that fully describes it.
It is possible in TRENPA too but we believe that important item information comes not only from items themselves but emerges from the network of relations between them.
On a functional level this information is naturally contained by a relational database.
SQL language operating relational databases is likely to stay for a foreseen future so if the database layout is clear, in the future it will be possible to retrieve information from it even if the current software is not there anymore.
So, ultimately, a proper underlying database should be preserved in a trustworthy way (backups, replication). 

TRENPA draws from the wealth of previous research and development in the area of digital library systems. Though not a full implementation, the TRENPA architecture has roots in Kahn and Wilenskyâ€™s Framework for Distributed Digital Object Services [7]_.


Metadata
--------

Trenpa Data Topology Diagram

TRENPA endorses the widely accepted Dublin Core metadata scheme. In most cases items extend it with additional properties. 
The Simple Dublin Core Metadata Element Set (DCMES) consists of 15 metadata elements: Title, Creator, Subject, Description, Publisher, Contributor, Date, Type, Format, Identifier, Source, Language, Relation, Coverage, Rights Implementations. 
There are additional fields for keywords, and technical metadata and rights metadata, among others. 

Broadly speaking, TRENPA holds three sorts of metadata about archived content:
 Descriptive, administrative and structural metadata.

**Descriptive Metadata**
   Each Item has one qualified Dublin Core metadata record which is extended depending on class to which the item belongs. 

**Administrative Metadata**
   This includes preservation metadata, provenance and authorization policy data. 

**Structural Metadata**
   This includes information about how to present an item to an end-user, and the relationships between constituent parts of the item (Bundle). As an example, consider a thesis consisting of a number of TIFF images, each depicting a single page of the thesis. Structural metadata would include the fact that each image is a single page, and the ordering of the TIFF images/pages.
   Relations with other items and a conceptual object (Event)  In the future TRENPA may comply to other metadata standards [16]_ like METS [10]_   Events ------ Event model is the highest level of Trenpa metadata organization. Each event data *'grosso modo'* answers four Ws: What? Where? When? Who?

Event may be composed of other events, for example a festival event may have multiple concert “child” events: a press conference, a theatrical performance,  etc.
This way even temporary, geographically despaired and complex events can be easily defined. The creation of overly complex events is not recommended. In most cases three levels of nested events should be enough.

.. image:: https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1EImitskwiMM_DqdvZ5wyWTpuxQbKdmWvro9pmE97qYU/pub?w=966&amp;h=688

For example: An event video has been recorded on MiniDV and an audio recording has been made on magnetic tapes and, later on those tapes have been digitalized to audio/video files. All those items posses the same semantic charge. So instead of describing semantic metadata for each one of them, metadata resides on event abstraction to which they all relate. In this way all those items may automatically inherit metadata from it. 

Event may posses time cues describing:

* speech - literal quotes
* semantic - tag describing the *topic* of a given scene
* situational - describes a change of situation


OAIS
----

Overall TRENPA architecture is based on the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS). 
OAIS is a reference model for long-term preservation of digital (and other) assets. While it does not specify the implementation or functional design, OAIS is an indispensable guide to creating an archive with an accepted set of roles, responsibilities and methods that encourage safe, long-term archival and access to critical government information.

Submission Information Package (SIP)
   is the information sent from the producer to the archive
Archival Information Package (AIP)
   is the information stored by the archive
Dissemination Information Package (DIP)
   is the information sent to a user when requested

OAIS benefits
The OAIS reference model:

* Is a well known and well understood model for long-term preservation. 
* Provides the discipline necessary to maintain the accessibility of packages and the interpretation of the information they contain even across changes in technology and changes in representation standards. 
* Clearly defines the roles of the actors (producers, consumers, managers) who interact with the archive. 
* Identifies the necessary controls required to maintain reliable archive management. 
* Identifies the documentation required to communicate the archiveâ€™s purpose and interactions to interested parties. 
* Applies the chain of custody of archived packages to ensure that documents are not inappropriately tampered with.

TRENPA Platform System Scheme

The main code of TRENPA is implemented in Python, and runs on any UNIX-like system such as Linux,  BSD Unix or Mac. It may work on Windows but it has not been tested. 

It makes use of several third-party open source systems: 

* **PostgreSQL**, an open source relational database system 
* **Django**, high level reach Python Framework 
* **Server**: Apache, Ligh 
* Other External Python and Django dependencies

Functional Overview
-------------------
<<<<<<< HEAD
The functional aspects of TRENPA can be summarized as follows:

* A data model for basic organization of data is defined. 
* Metadata  of various types is stored by the system. 
* The system stores information about users of the system. Some users might not be humans but other computerized systems. 
* While much of the effort is concerned with easing access to an institutionâ€™s digital material, simply allowing full public access is not always acceptable.  Additionally functions such as depositing and reviewing must be restricted to appropriate individuals. Hence the system includes an authorization function. 
* All relevant actions on the archive content should be logged together with detailed description of resulting change. 
* The system must be able to accept incoming material (ingestion). 
* Some communities may require that material or accompanying metadata entering the archive be checked or augmented by designated individuals. This process is called work-flow. 
* In order that material in the archive may be cited and accessed using information in a citation globally unique persistent identifiers are assigned to archived objects (â€˜itemsâ€™). 
* End users should be able to explore and discover the contents of the repository. To this end, TRENPA must offer search and browse functions. 
* TRENPA should enable diverse communities collaboration on ingestion, cataloguing, metadata enrichment (*crowd-sourcing*) together with tools for community moderation and content !!br0ken!! 
* It should be possible to notify end users of the system when new content of interest to them appears in the archive, rather than requiring them to repeatedly access TRENPA to check this. TRENPA should offer an automatic e-mail alerting service (subscription). 
* A Web user interface provides access to the above functionality.
